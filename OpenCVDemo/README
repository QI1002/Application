Some items shall be noticed 
1. if you use OpenCV 2.4.11 android SDK, then cmake of SDK will fail in 
OpenCVConfig.cmake because ${ANDROID_NDK_ABI_NAME} in android studio 3.2.1
may be "arm64-v8a"

2. you can find the javah in android studio in path ./jre/bin   
goto java class location (ex: app/src/main/java ) and type 
~/android-studio/jre/bin/javah io.github.qi1002.opencvdemo.JniActivity 
to get io_github_qi1002_opencvdemo_JniActivity.h to let JNI cpp use

3. the ndk r18b not support gnustl, only libc++_static. so we shall rollback 
to r16b and change to use gnustl by -DANDROID_STL=gnustl_shared in 
app build.gradle although it support both but use libc++_static in default.

4. use 'abiFilters "armeabi-v7a", "arm64-v8a", "x86_64"' in app build.gradle 
 to support APK   support native architecture. 

[TODO]
1. how to get camera permission and reboot to use camera ? 
2. how to retrieve the installation for openCV manager ?
3. how to put face detection of openCV sample in android studio 3.2.1 ?
