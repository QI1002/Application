Some items shall be noticed 
0. refer the android studio 3 + openCV teach link website 
   => https://www.jianshu.com/p/6e16c0429044
   refer how to strip the usage of OpenCV manager and build native opencv 
   shared libraies in android studio 
   => https://www.jianshu.com/p/b260ebb1c180

1. if you use OpenCV 2.4.11 android SDK, then cmake of SDK will fail in 
OpenCVConfig.cmake because ${ANDROID_NDK_ABI_NAME} in android studio 3.2.1
may be "arm64-v8a"

2. you can find the javah in android studio in path ./jre/bin   
goto java class location (ex: app/src/main/java ) and type 
~/android-studio/jre/bin/javah io.github.qi1002.opencvdemo.JniActivity 
to get io_github_qi1002_opencvdemo_JniActivity.h to let JNI cpp use

3. the ndk r18b not support gnustl, only libc++_static. so we shall rollback 
to r16b and change to use gnustl by -DANDROID_STL=gnustl_shared in 
app build.gradle although it support both but use libc++_static in default.

4. use 'abiFilters "armeabi-v7a", "arm64-v8a", "x86_64"' in app build.gradle 
 to support APK   support native architecture. 

5. you can install OpenCV Manager APK in OpenCV SDK, but you shall install 
the right version, ex: armeabi-v7a or arm64-v8a or ... 

6. if you have the prebuilt shared libaries and hope to link it by jni, 
please put it in app/src/main/jniLibs 

7. java.lang.IllegalStateException: You need to use a Theme.AppCompat theme (or descendant) with this activity => you need to use a theme in app AndroidManifest.xml that is compatible to android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity

[TODO]
1. how to build openCV in android environment (by NDK?)
2. how to let the face detection sample with menu ?
3. how to use the CascadeClassifier & OclCascadeClassifier ?
